        <h1 class="fontStyle textCenter">Thank You Sir Ratan Tata</h1>
        <div class="thanks">
          Ratan Tata is truly a person who is one of a kind. Although being the
          Chairman Emeritus of Tata Group of Industries, he is known for many
          other reasons, one among them is motivating speeches and quotes. He is
          a philanthropist who donated huge sum of money for pressing causes.
          Ratan Tata donates 66% of the company’s profits each year to the
          Trust. We always fall short of words while sharing our gratitude for
          such a great and amazing personality. Everything Sir Ratan TATA has
          done for India and its economy is something only a legend and a person
          who seeks to promote the welfare of others, especially by the generous
          donation of money to good causes can do.
